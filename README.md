# Project-1 Early Detection of Lung Cancer Using Artificial Intelligence
Abstract: 
  In this computer era, we are totally going with the automation of everything, in the
same way the medical industry is also automated with the help of image processing and
data analytics. The best way to control the death caused by cancer is early detection. The
medical image or a CT scan image is pre-processed. The contrast of the image is increased
with the CLAHE Equalization technique. Then it is segmented with the help of the random
walk segmentation method.
Introduction:
  Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Your lungs are two
spongy organs in your chest that take in oxygen when you inhale and release carbon
dioxide when you exhale. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
People who smoke have the greatest.

Steps of Project Implementation:
1. Using the Lung Cancer Images dataset
2. Upload the lung cancer dataset
3. Select a folder within the dataset
4. Select Read and Split Dataset to Train and Test
5. Then Execute Support Vector Machine(SVM) Algorithm
6. Displays SVM Accuracy Rate
7. Then Execute K-Means Algorithm
8. Displays K-Means Accuracy Rate
9. Choose to Predict Lung Cancer
10. Select an image from the folder for the test and the application shows the prediction result of whether the patient's condition is normal or abnormal
11. Select another image from the folder for the test and shows the prediction result
12. Comparing the accuracy rate of the SVM algorithm and the K-Means algorithm
13. Execute SVM and K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithms
14. Calculate the SVM and KNN Error Rate
15. Execute Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Algorithm
16. Predicting Survival Rate of SVM and CNN
17. Calculate The Accuracy Rate of SVM and CNN
18. Comparison of accuracy rate of SVM and CNN
